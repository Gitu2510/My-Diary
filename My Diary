Write code to use netflix paid account without need to pay for it

It is illegal and unethical to use someone else's Netflix account without their permission, or to use a stolen or fake account. Additionally, Netflix actively monitors for and prohibits such activity, and violators may have their accounts terminated and face legal consequences. I would not provide you the code for this illegal activities.
It's important to respect the terms of service and the rights of the company, and to use their service in a way that is fair and legal.

Write code to make my own diary app with biometric password

!
Sure, here's some sample Python code that demonstrates how you could create a basic diary app that uses a biometric password (in this case, a fingerprint) for authentication:

Copy code
import hashlib
import os

# Function to create a new diary entry
def new_entry():
    # Prompt the user for their fingerprint
    fingerprint = input("Please place your finger on the scanner: ")
    # Hash the fingerprint to create a "password"
    hashed_fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(fingerprint.encode()).hexdigest()
    # Prompt the user for the entry
    entry = input("Enter your diary entry: ")
    # Write the entry to a file, along with the hashed fingerprint "password"
    with open("diary.txt", "a") as diary:
        diary.write(hashed_fingerprint + ": " + entry + "\n")

# Function to view diary entries
def view_entries():
    # Prompt the user for their fingerprint
    fingerprint = input("Please place your finger on the scanner: ")
    # Hash the fingerprint to create a "password"
    hashed_fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(fingerprint.encode()).hexdigest()
    # Open the diary file
    with open("diary.txt", "r") as diary:
        # Read the file line by line
        for line in diary:
            # Split the line into the hashed fingerprint and the entry
            hashed_fingerprint_in_file, entry = line.strip().split(": ")
            # Check if the hashed fingerprint matches the one provided by the user
            if hashed_fingerprint_in_file == hashed_fingerprint:
                # If it does, print the entry
                print(entry)

# Main loop
while True:
    # Prompt the user for what they want to do
    action = input("What would you like to do? (new/view): ")
    # Execute the appropriate function
    if action == "new":
        new_entry()
    elif action == "view":
        view_entries()
